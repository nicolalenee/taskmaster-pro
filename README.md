## Description
This application allows users to create new tasks and their due dates. 
Users will be able to drag and drop tasks in specific categories depending on that task's completion status. 

## Technology
We're utilizing the power of the jQuery library alongside jQuery UI, jQuery Touch Punch, Popper, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. These tools help provide smooth user experiences for dragging and dropping, calendar date selection, and date formatting.
