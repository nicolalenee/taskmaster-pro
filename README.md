## Description
This interactive application allows users to create new tasks and their due dates. Introducing interactivity, such as being able to drag and drop webpage elements, invite users to feel more involved in the process of managing their tasks. This leads to a greater sense of personal accomplishment by the end user and can motivate them to use the application more frequently. This web application is also very easy to use and understand so first time visitors will not be drawn away due to an overly-complicated interface.
